Click on the Nicnt Maker
edit the values and generate a nicnt file.

Move this file in your library root folder.
then use 
Add Library tool for non NKS or home made libraries


if the size of the tool don't show normally,
adjust your display preference scalling on 100% 
instead of default 125% on windows laptop.


for custom libraries, 
all SNPID will not be showing in kontakt, 3 letters don't work well. (half on amd, not on intel)
it is better to use 1 not used letter and 2 number.   D00 to D99, E00 to E99, etc
it is the only joke for custom material, if you add something that is not seen in the library list.
the nicnt and the xml in service center must match, it can use ras2 or ras3 auth mode.
have a look to SNPID Lister to know what letter + digit you can use without conflict with official registration.


add library tool also write the library location here (it was used for Kontakt 5)
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Native Instruments
you can delete and clean new additions, but also oldies residual keys in case of conflict or not matching data's.

Kontakt 6 & 7 only use
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Native Instruments
